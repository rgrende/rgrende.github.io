    <h4>TOP HOST: HostGator</h4>
    <p>HostGator won my vote for best web host because of the fair prices that are offered down the line. I appreciate how this web hosting site gives users the options to choose between Linux and Windows hosting. HostGator has a list of domain services that other web hosting sites do not offer, such as reseller hosting.</p>
