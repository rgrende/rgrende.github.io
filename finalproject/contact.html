        <h1>Welcome to the site all about Bigfork, MONTANA SEASONS!</h1>
        <p>The seasons in Montana are unlike others. Did you know that Montana's climate is dictated by the Rocky Mountains? The Spring kicks off in late March and runs through May. The summer rolls around in June and the daytime highs reach the upper 70sÂ°F. The fall comes pretty quick in mid-September. Winter arrives even faster by the beginning of November and somtimes lingers a bit longer than expected. Overall, Montana has something to offer during every season!</p>
