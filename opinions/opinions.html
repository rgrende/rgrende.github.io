    <header1> The Winner for the "Terrific Website" goes to: </header1>
<h1><a href ="https://www.airforce.com">The Air Force</a></h1>
<p>This is one of the best websites I’ve explored. I love how interactive the linked pages are alongside the easily accessible, well-organized drop-down menu. The Air Force website is better than most because of the graphics and images that are displayed. Not only are they in what seems to be high definition, they really capture what the Air Force is all about from various viewpoints. The code for this site is clear, modern, and easily identifiable. The site uses some HTML 5 elements (head, body, title) and there doesn’t seem to be any signs of table usage. The code, however, does validate, especially the style sheet, which made sense to me. 
The layout of the pages on the Air Force’s website is nicely put together and has a scrolling effect. 
<p>On the main page there are rows of information listed inside cool pictures. Practically anyone can visit this page and navigate around it pretty well. You don’t have to worry about knowing anything about the Air Force prior to coming to this website. The pictures really capture a variety of different colors effectively. The colors of the text, navy blue, white, black, stand out against the hues of the high definition pictures. This site does a great job of using interactive tabs, menus, and images. The theme of the website has the capability to pursue the user to want to explore it more in depth. The Air Force’s homepage also keeps this user engaged with real video footage of Air Force Pilots and has interesting effects on some of the icons. The site is simple yet it possesses cool little things that set it apart from others of its kind. Please note, this is not the military’s website for the United States Air Force.

<header2>The Runner up for "Terrific Website" goes to:</header2>
<h2><a href ="https://www.crossfit.com
">CrossFit</a></h2>
<p>The CrossFit website is overall a great, well organized, site. It has a variety of images, clear information on different boxes, the CrossFit Games, and even home workouts. The website is different from others in the sense that it is alluring and prompts users to explore what it has to offer. The code uses HTML5 elements but is difficult to read at times. They do not use tables and the code does seem to validate.  The layout makes sense to me as it is clearly organized and pushes me to want to look further into the page. There is a nice scrolling effect that allows the user to see the different aspects of the site which is broken down into portions. 
<p>The menu is easy to navigate as well as the pages that are linked. 
The colors associated with this page are used effectively. The pictures add a nice splash of color to the website. The text is bright and fun, with shades of blue and black. I really like how this page is clear and makes great use of the white spaces with images and links to other pages. The footer, a picture of the world map, is cool for it represents the idea that CrossFit is known globally. I also enjoy the fact that the text used throughout the page is simple and consistent. One small, small detail that is cool about this website is the small calendar in the top right corner next to the search bar.

<header3>The Winner of the Terrible Website goes to:</header3>
<h3><a href ="https://www.craigslist.org/about/sites
">Craigslist</a></h3>       
<p>I can’t tell if Cragslist is trying to be boring, uninteresting, yet simple, or if there is just a lack of creativity at the HQ. If you haven’t guessed it already, this is the terrible website. I strongly dislike the lack of images, colors, and even the layout of Craigslist. There is nothing that catches my eye, nor is there anything that wants me to continue to explore the page itself. The code for this site is pretty basic and uses a head, body, section, title, etc. However, the majority of the code consists of “a ref” links to other pages for different cities across the world. Besides the code being a little on the unorganized side, I could make out the different elements. 
<p>The layout is simple, yet I am not a fan. There are columns used to arrange cities by state, which I will admit do keep things simple but there is no pizzazz. There is a nice scrolling effect but it really needs to be due to all of the countries and cities that use Craigslist, needless to say the main page is long. The page is fairly easy to navigate through. For example, if I select Montana, then Kalispell, I am directed to three columns with headers like, housing, community, jobs, and items for sale.</p>
<p>This site has two main colors: purple and blue, not to mention they are just the color of the text. Craigslist does not use colors effectively, let alone does it use color at all. One of the little things that irks me about this website is the fact that the words are all lowercase. At least the font used throughout is the same and isn't comic sans. There are no cool icons and the page doesn’t have a great use of whitespace.
