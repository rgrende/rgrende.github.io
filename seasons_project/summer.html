        <h1>Summer</h1>
        <p>Summer in Bigfork is glorious. The months of July - Spetmember tend to be dry and hot. While it doesn't get too terribly hot, sunshine is the norm with a few rain and thunderstorms now and then. Many people like to visit Glacier National Park in the summer. Flathead Lake, the biggest fresh body of water west of the Mississippi, is a staple and is everyone's favorite place on the 4th of July. There are many places to rent kayaks, paddle boards, and even different types of watercraft. </p>
