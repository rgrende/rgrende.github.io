        <h1>Winter</h1>
        <p>Montana is known by many for it's bipolar temperatures ranging from 45°F to -45°F. While the winter months can seem long and cold, they can be interrupted by a warm, dry chinook wind that can last for ten days or more. Montana does hold the National record for a whooping 70-degrees-below-zero reading near Helena. People who enjoy skiing, snowboarding, and other snow sports are some of the few who enjoy the winter months. The Black Tail and Big Mountain Ski Resorts are extremely popular and within an hour from Bigfork.    </p>
