        <p>On January 1st, 2021, Netflix said goodbye to the The Office after a long run as one of their most watched shows. The show is set at a paper company in Scranton, PA that is created to look and feel like a documentary. With a cast of about every kind of person you would find at a typical "office style" environment, they are bound to make you laugh and occationally cry.</p>
