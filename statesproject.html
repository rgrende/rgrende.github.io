    <h1><a href="https://www.vermont.gov">1. Vermont</a></h1>
            <p>This page is beautiful. The pictures are in high definiton, the colorful aoura is pleasing to the eye, and has a simple state logo at the top.
            The webpage loads very fast and takes almost no time to get from page to page. The menu is very easy to navigate through. It a clear and concise menut that is well organized. I can eaily find items within this webpage. If I wanted to know more information about historic sites in Vermont, I would go to the menu and under "Explore" I would find a tab called, "Historic Sites." The website looks pretty good on a smaller screen. The high defintion pictures make the webpage look great on any size screen. I also really like the accent colors on this page.
    
    This website is my favorite because of its simplicity but also it's organization. The menu was easy to access and the information was clear. I also really liked how colorful the home was with it's high definition pictures. Not to mention, the code for this website was easier to read than others. </p>
       
            
    
    <h2><a href="https://www.iowa.gov">2. Iowa </a></h2>
            <p>The color and design of Iowa's webpage is very pleasing to the eye. It is colorful, not in a rainbow-threwup-kind-of way. It's subtle and adds to the organization of the page. The navy blue is a good solid color and easy to view.
            Since there is a lot going on within the first page, I found that as I was scrolling the page took a second to load. In my opinion, this isn't a big deal. 
            The menu is easy to navigate through. There are seven topics in the drop down menu which is just the right amount. If there was anymore I think it would really crowd your screen. 
            The items on this webpage can be easily found. For example, I want to file an income tax online, I would go to General and the tab that said, "Filing Income Taxes Online."
            This website would be okay on a smaller screen. However, I perosnally would not want to look at it on a smart phone. I do like that this site included state facts. For example, it gives you the state seal, flower, bird, tree, and flag. I didnt like that it reloaded a few times becuase "it was using succifent memory." </p>
    
    <h3><a href="https://www.tn.gov">3. Tennessee </a></h3>
            <p>Tennessee's webpage is patriotic to say the least. I do like the aesthetic of the colors and the way the page is laid out. It is very professional looking.
            The website loads slower compared to some of the other websites. This could be due to all of the information on the page.The menu bar is neatly listed across the top and each individual bar has a small drop down menu. The page is nicley organized and I feel like I would be able to find whatever I was looking for. If I wanted to find who the governer of the state is, I would go to government, then governer.The webiste would look a little busy on a smaller screen but would still be easy to navigate through.</p>
    
    <h4><a href="https://www.alaska.gov"> 4. Alaska </a></h4>
            <p>The blue and yellow gradiaents around the top of the page are nice complements to eachother. I find them pleasing to the eye. The designs at the bottom of the page are really neat as well as the watermarks within the menus. However, the top of the page is boring and lacks an eyecatcher.
            The site loaded quickly and efficently. The other pages were directed quickly too.
            The website itself is very easy to navigate through. It is very well organized. I don't think I would have to use the search bar located at the top. 
            The items within the web page are very easy to find. If I wanted to look for available jobs in Alaska, I would go to services then jobs, easy peasy. There is a lot of of information on the page, so making the window smaller or looking at it from a smart phone, would be frustrating. It looks and fits better in a larger screen.</p>
    
    
    
    <h5><a href="https://www.oklahoma.gov">5. Oklahoma</a></h5>
            <p>This website is very boring. I like some of the visuals but there are like four of them. It's simple, yes, but almost too simple.The webiste loads quickly.
            I couldn't find the menu at first. When I did find it, the directory page loaded quickly and had almost 20 seperate tabs. It's pretty easy to navigate through.
            Like I stated before, I couldn't find anything on the home page of the website. Once I did, the items were failry easy to find. If I wanted to find out about the college in Oklahoma, I would go to the education tab and scroll down to the list of colleges.
            Due to it's simplicity, this website would look decent on a smaller scale.
    
    This webpage is my least favorite because of the lack of creativity and direction. There is nothing that draws me to the items on the page. It was also difficult to find the menu and when I did locate it, there was way to many items listed under each tab. Another aspect of this website that I did not enjoy was the code. I thought it was hard to read. </p>
